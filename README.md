## Key Technologies Used
- YOLO from Ultralytics and Roboflow for precise player and tennis ball detection
- PyTorch CNN for robust tennis court keypoint extraction
- Pandas for calculating and analyzing player movement speed, ball shot speed, and shot count
- OpenCV for presenting statistical insights on the video

## Data-Driven Insights
With detailed statistics on player movements, shot speed, and frequency, this system empowers players and coaches to identify strengths and weaknesses, refine strategies, and enhance overall performance.
